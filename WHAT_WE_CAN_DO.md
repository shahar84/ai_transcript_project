Once you have the transcript, itâ€™s just text â€” and AI can do almost anything with text.

## 1. Practical Uses
- **Summarize** the video into:
  - 5-bullet key takeaways
  - A one-paragraph TL;DR

- **Create meeting notes** from a recorded call
- **Generate captions/subtitles** (SRT file)
- **Turn the transcript into a blog post or article**
- **Extract keywords** for SEO or tagging
